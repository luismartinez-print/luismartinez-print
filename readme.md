I'm Luis Martinez and I am passionate about Revenue Management and Data Science.

Here I save my projects that mostly revolve on these two topics, almoast all of them are because of personal interest.

My projects focus on inventory optimization for contrained capacity, forecasting, descriptive and predictive analytics and revenue management system design.

### Projects


I have done a couple of projects so far, but my favorites have to be:

* **[Generative DNA Sequencing](https://github.com/luismartinez-print/gen_dna)**: Implemented via Deep Learning (LSTM).
* **[SaaS Revenue Management System](https://github.com/luismartinez-print/rev-data)**: A prototype for managing revenue for multiple hotels.

The language I use primarily is python, however I often use R and SQL with other tools for rendering and IDEs.
